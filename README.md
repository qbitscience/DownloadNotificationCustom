Download Service with Percentage Progress Notification
In this tutorial we have worked on notification service,
where we can see the percentage of download video,image,zip etc. in notification.
Its not yet complete tutorial because it is not for backend service.
One can view FCM push notification tutorial for background service,or can wait for 
future changes.
Its your choice to add percentage progress. But remember it can drain your battery.
So you need to take extra care of that.
Happy Coding.
